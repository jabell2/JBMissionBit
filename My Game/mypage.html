		<h2> About me: </h2>
		<p> My name is Jackie. I am 14 and do weightlifting. </p>
		<h2> Coding experience </h2>
		<p> I have learned a little bit of python and html. In the future I want to learn C++ and ruby on rails since it is becoming more popular and more widely used. First learning to code is intimidating but I really want to learn and get to know more. After learning how to read one language it should be easier to learn others.
